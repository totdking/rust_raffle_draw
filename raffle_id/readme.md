This is a simple rust algo randomizing and picking already stored entries, the bigger project would be uploaded later

When you fork or clone the repo to your local repo or device, you would need rust installed (windows, mac or linux os). 
They can be all gotten from rustlang.org

When installed and you want to run the file, run cargo build to install the rand dependency in the cargo.toml file.

This is still a prototype, I will use this as a baseline to build for a solana token raffle program :)
